3. Load the extension by clicking on the `Load unpacked` button on the top left.
4. Select the folder from Step 1 that holds `darkmode.css` and `manifest.json`.
5. The extension should now be loaded into your browser. Make sure the extension is enabled.
6. Visit [https://skeb.jp/](https://skeb.jp/) and enjoy your Dark Mode Skeb experience!
7. You can manage the extension like any other extension. You can disable and remove the extension as needed.
8. To update to the latest version of the extension, remove/delete the extension and repeat the steps starting with Step 1 using the latest version of the code.

## About the Extension

This extension only adds a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to Skeb pages. The CSS file only recolors elements on the page to create the dark mode theme. It does not scrape data from the Skeb page and only makes cosmetic changes.

If you encounter a bug or would like to request changes, please contact Yoostink.

There are currently no plans to publish this extension to the Google Web Store.
